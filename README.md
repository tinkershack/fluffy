# Fluffy - A 'free' watchdog for Linux on-disk filesystems [WIP]

__Fluffy__ is a convenient CLI tool, __libfluffy__ is what you 
will find under the hood. libfluffy uses the inotify kernel subsystem.

There are challenges in using the native [inotify][] library 
effectively; [Michael Kerrisk][] provides a lucid description. Fluffy's 
magic cuts through all the challenges cleanly.

### Why Fluffy?

There are other implementations of filesystem watchers already, why 
Fluffy?

 - Linux specific; Fluffy is not cross platform, but loyal to Linux.  
   Linux has its tricks, \*BSD has its, so does Solaris. It only makes
   sense to have separate implementations for each of it to fully 
   utilize the exclusive features which aren't available across all
   platforms. If the features aren't very diverse, then it's only a 
   matter of porting; though it may be painful it's relatively less 
   painful than an all-in-one model. Besides, a platform specific 
   library helps keep the code base clean and lean. It's simpler. If you 
   are thinking POSIX, please think again why many of the popular 
   operating systems aren't POSIX/SUS compliant.

 - Reports events faithfully.  
   There are popular libraries/tools built already that do a poor job 
   at reporting the events - wrong event path, erroneous event handling, 
   erroneous event reporting, oblivious to filesystem 
   structure/hierarchy changes(dir moves especially), can't add watches 
   on the fly without re-executing(reinitiating) the program(library).
   After considering various aspects of the process, building from 
   scratch seemed better than fixing the broken ones. 

 - Add/remove watch paths on the fly.

 - A fully functional library that utilizes the native inotify kernel 
   subsystem properly. This means, unlike few tools, the events are not 
   limited to just file 'modifications'. Every possible event action 
   like 'open', 'access', 'close', 'no write', 'delete', 'move' is 
   caught. User has the flexibility(control?) to discard/process select 
   events. 

 - Freedom. NO GPL shit.  
   Fluffy has three heads. It likes to flip the middle one to licensing.

### [libfluffy](#contents)

_libfluffy_ is a better choice if you are planning to use it in 
production. [fluffy.h][] has the interface description and callables.  
[example.c][] provides a sample.

libfluffy code is fairly documented. [fluffy.h][] would be good place to 
start the trail. From there, jump to the corresponding function 
definition in `fluffy.c` and follow the calls thereafter. Should you 
feel that it's a bit confusing, head to the [example.c][] to get a sense 
of the flow.

#### API list

Please look at [fluffy.h][] for description. This is just a list of 
function calls available.

__Primary functions__

```c
int fluffy_init(int (*user_event_fn) (
    const struct fluffy_event_info *eventinfo,
    void *user_data), void *user_data);

int fluffy_add_watch_path(int fluffy_handle, const char *pathtoadd);

int fluffy_remove_watch_path(int fluffy_handle, const char *pathtoremove);

int fluffy_wait_until_done(int fluffy_handle);

int fluffy_no_wait(int fluffy_handle);

int fluffy_destroy(int fluffy_handle);
```

__Helper functions__

```c
int fluffy_print_event(const struct fluffy_event_info *eventinfo,
    void *user_data);

int fluffy_reinitiate_context(int fluffy_handle);

int fluffy_reinitiate_all_contexts();

int fluffy_set_max_queued_events(const char *max_size);

int fluffy_set_max_user_instances(const char *max_size);

int fluffy_set_max_user_watches(const char *max_size);
```

### [CLI invocations](#contents)

#### fluffy usage

```bash
root@six-k:~# fluffy -h
Usage:
  fluffy [OPTION...] [exit]

Help Options:
  -h, --help                     Show help options

Application Options:
  -O, --outfile=./out.fluffy     File to print output [default:stdout]
  -E, --errfile=./err.fluffy     File to print errors [default:stderr]

```

#### fluffyctl usage

```bash
root@six-k:~# fluffyctl --help-all
Usage:
  fluffyctl [OPTION...] ["/path/to/hogwarts/kitchen"]

'fluffyctl' controls 'fluffy' program.
fluffy must be invoked before adding/removing watches.  By default all 
file system events are watched and reported. --help-events will show the 
options to modify this behaviour

Help Options:
  -h, --help                                      Show help options
  --help-all                                      Show all help options
  --help-events                                   File system events to report

When an option or more from 'events' group is passed, only those events 
will be reported. When a new invocation of fluffyctl sets any 'events' 
option, previously set events choice is discarded; overrides.

  --all                                           Watch all possible events [default]
  --access                                        Watch file access
  --modify                                        Watch file modifications
  --attrib                                        Watch metadata change

  --close-nowrite                                 Watch closing of file/dir not opened for writing
  --open                                          Watch opening of file/dir
  --moved-from                                    Watch renames/moves: reports old file/dir name
  --moved-to                                      Watch renames/moves: reports new file/dir name
  --create                                        Watch creation of files/dirs
  --delete                                        Watch deletion of files/dirs
  --root-delete                                   Watch root path deletions
  --root-move                                     Watch root path moves/renames
  --isdir                                         Watch for events that occur against a directory
  --unmount                                       Watch for unmount of the backing filesystem ['isdir' not raised]
  --queue-overflow                                Watch for event queue overflows ['isdir' not raised]
  --ignored                                       Watch for paths ignored by Fluffy(not watched) ['isdir' not raised]
  --root-ignored                                  Watch for root paths ignored(not watched) ['isdir' not raised]
  --watch-empty                                   Watch whether all Fluffy watches are removed ['isdir' not raised]

Application Options:
  -w, --watch=/grimmauld/place/12                 Paths to watch recursively. Repeat flag for multiple paths.
  -W, --watch-glob                                Paths to watch recursively: supports wildcards. Any non-option argument passed will be considered as paths. [/hogwarts/*/towers]
  -i, --ignore=/knockturn/alley/borgin/brukes     Paths to ignore recursively. Repeat flag for multiple paths.
  -I, --ignore-glob                               Paths to ignore recursively: supports wildcards. Any non-option argument passed will be considered as paths. [/hogwarts/*/dungeons]
  -U, --max-user-watches=524288                   Upper limit on the number of watches per uid [fluffy defaults 524288]
  -Q, --max-queued-events=524288                  Upper limit on the number of events [fluffy defaults 524288]
  -z, --reinit                                    Reinitiate watch on all root paths. [Avoid unless necessary]

#### Perform actions on events from CLI

**CAUTION** It's recommended that you use `libfluffy` to perform 
sophisticated actions on events rather than scripting with CLI usage. 

Let's consider a trivial action: `ls -l` the path on a MODIFY event

At terminal:1

```bash
root@six-k:/home/lab/fluffy# fluffy | \
while read events path; do \
    if echo $events | grep -qie "MODIFY"; then \
        ls -l $path; \
    fi \
done
```

At terminal:2

```bash
root@six-k:/opt/test2# fluffyctl -w ./
root@six-k:/opt/test2# touch f1
root@six-k:/opt/test2# ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Mar 18 19:38 f1
root@six-k:/opt/test2# echo "this is a MODIFY" | cat >> f1
root@six-k:/opt/test2# echo "this is another MODIFY" | cat >> f1
root@six-k:/opt/test2# fluffy exit
```

Output from terminal:1: [cont.]

```bash
root@six-k:/home/lab/fluffy# fluffy | \
> while read events path; do \
>     if echo $events | grep -qie "MODIFY"; then \
>         ls -l $path; \
>     fi \
> done
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 17 Mar 18 19:38 /opt/test2/f1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 40 Mar 18 19:38 /opt/test2/f1
root@six-k:/home/lab/fluffy# 
```


### [TODO: Fluffy is a WIP](#contents)

There's still quite a few more to be done but these are the primary ones

 - Documentation _WIP_
 - Proper error reporting. For now, most error returns have been set -1 
   deliberately without any error string or value.
 - Valgrind
 - Test cases

 - Other helper functions
   - Destroy all contexts
   - Emit internal events(eg. watches set, file info) for analytics
   - Get the list of root watch paths
 - Option to terminate context thread when watch list becomes empty
 - Ability to modify callback function pointer
